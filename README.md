To improve Store sales performance, the company should focus on targeting women customers aged 30–49 years residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Marketing efforts such as personalized ads, promotional offers, and discount coupons should be strategically promoted through high-performing platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
